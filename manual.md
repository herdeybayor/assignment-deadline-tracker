### Understanding the Smart Priority System

The app automatically calculates a priority score (0-100) for each assignment using:

**40% - Due Date Proximity**
- Assignments due sooner get higher scores
- Overdue assignments get maximum points
- Long-term assignments get lower scores

**30% - Estimated Time Required**
- Longer assignments get higher priority scores
- Helps you start big projects early

**30% - Your Manual Priority Level**
- Your chosen priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Reflects the assignment's importance to your grades
- Overrides time-based calculations when needed

**Example Priority Calculations:**
- Assignment due tomorrow + 10 hours estimated + Critical priority = ~95/100
- Assignment due next week + 2 hours estimated + Medium priority = ~35/100
- Assignment due next month + 1 hour estimated + Low priority = ~15/100
